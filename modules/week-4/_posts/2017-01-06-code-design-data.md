## App Lab - Code, Design and Data

[App Lab](https://code.org/educate/applab)

In this section, I will provide a short video on what each of these sections means. You might want to take a look, and then we will go through an example to see how it works.  I won't ask you to do anything specific with the Data section, but I will go through it in case anyone wants to get crazy and use it.

Now, you design something and see how it turns out.

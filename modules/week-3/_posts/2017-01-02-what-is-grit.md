<p>First I would like to address that Grit doesn't paint the complete picture and I have some issues with the over-justification of it. However this term Grit, as Angela Duckworth adresses, grants us another tool to anaylze success. A person with true grit has passion and perseverance that will help them achieve goals are set and followed through. "Intelligence" (and I use the term loosely) and "talent" are not always the advantage.  A person who works really hard to follow through on commitments has true grit. </p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from her website "... grit—a combination of passion and perseverance for a singularly important goal—is the hallmark of high achievers in every domain. She’s also found scientific evidence that grit can grow."</p>

Lets look at sprites, costumes and backdrops. 

Sprites are a common game design element acting as movable visual images in your projects. Each sprite contains multiple costumes. 

Costumes in Scratch serve a couple of purposes.  You can think of them like regular costumes. You can have the cat wear a tie and a suit.  You can have the cat have shorts and a t-shirt.  You can also have different costumes for the cat to help mimic a more realistic movement. Feel free to create your outfits too!

Please make sure you add multiple costumes and be able to switch between them.
